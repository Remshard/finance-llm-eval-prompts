# Finance LLM Evaluation Prompts

This project contains synthetic examples of how I evaluate large language model (LLM) responses to complex finance and accounting prompts.

## Focus Areas
- GAAP and IFRS reasoning
- Deferred tax, inventory, and goodwill logic
- SEC filings and accounting disclosures
- Errors in valuation, cost modeling, and transaction analysis

## Each example includes:
- The original prompt
- The model’s (hypothetical) answer
- A detailed evaluation of reasoning or factual errors
- A corrected version or refined prompt

All content is created for portfolio purposes and does not reference or use confidential work.
